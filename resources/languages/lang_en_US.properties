AboutMsg = The program enables the user to construct deterministic finite automaton and pushdown automaton with the help of either descriptive text or graphical tools. The graphical display allows the user to create and place states, and to define transition functions between those states. The user can also create an automaton through text data, which displays graphically after uploading. The user can inspect how the automaton works with various input words. The program displays whether the automaton runs successfully, and moreover, it shows the steps taken during the run, thus helping the user understand how a given automaton functions.
